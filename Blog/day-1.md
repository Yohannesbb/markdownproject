## My question about working on CSS with regards to markdown was answered well
would like to learn more about markdown syntax
1. read about markdown
2. study the sytax and memorize as much as possible
3. apply some of them on your project

| Yohannes  |  Berhane   |  Bahta  |    
| --- | ---- | ---- |
|Child | Father | Grandfather    |    
| Given name   | Middle Name    | Last Name   |
|First Name    | Second Name   |  Surname  |    
| Son  |  dad   | pops   |
 
``` that is a test block ```

Another sytax example is the ~~strike~~ . This should be enough for today, until I change it.
