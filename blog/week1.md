The questions were really a great way to encourage student to start a blog.
Sme of the Q&A were

### Why are side projects important?
Most students answered the question as they relate their life to a different kind of side Business.
The most common answeres were: 
1. Side business help a person to build skills and make some extra money; 
2. May lead to an important project; an example of that is the Facebook Thumbs Up Like icon was a side business.  That icon is one of the commonly used icon.

### Is side business unique to web development?
1. No side business is not unique to web development.
People who are incline to any type of art make money and develop thier skills by having a side business.  Some people do videography, photography, music, and even painting. The more time a person spend on a skill, the better they get and the more money they would be able to generate from the side business.

### How would you describe “Thinking like a Programmer?”
1.  Thinking like a programmer is thinking out of the box
2.  Thinking like an inventor:  See a problem - find a solution
3.  Is learning every single day a new information and practicing new skills

### How can you stay focussed
1.  Do what you know already.  If you try to learn more before understanding what you should know about the program you will get lost.
2.  Even if your project looks ugly but correctly made, there is always time to improve it

### Other covered topics
* What is Markdown
* How does markdown covert to html
* What is markdown good for
* When is it preferable to use HTML instead of Markdown or viceversa

All the above topics were covered during the last session of the class.  There is additional assignment.  For the next class assignment please go back to [My Index Page](./index.md) and click on [Week2 Lessons](./week2.md)

### The Tutors forgot to get dinner!! :(

### The Takeaway is as follows and is *copied from the sprint*

When developing on your own, you have total control on what goes into your project and how it is written. The code for your project only has to make sense to you! However, as soon as you have another person look at your code, you have make sure your code makes sense to others too. If your code is not understandable to other developers, then they won’t be able to make good comments and help you out, and they also won’t want to add your code to their project. Viewed this way, code is a language that everybody needs to understand in order to work together. Just like any other language, we have some common practice that help us understand each other. For instance, when developing HTML, we want to make sure any tags that open are also closed

**BELOW IS ALSO SOME OF THE EXERCISES I PERSONALLY COMPLETED**
## My question about working on CSS with regards to markdown was answered well
would like to learn more about markdown syntax
1. read about markdown
2. study the sytax and memorize as much as possible
3. apply some of them on your project

| JOHN |  DEE  |  DEO |    
| --- | ---- | ---- |
|Child | Father | Grandfather    |    
| Given name   | Middle Name    | Last Name   |
|First Name    | Second Name   |  Surname  |    
| Son  |  dad   | pops   |
 
``` that is a test block ```

Another sytax example is the ~~strike~~ . This should be enough for today, until I change it.
