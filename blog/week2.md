  * 10 best practices in html and
  * 12 principles for keeping your code clean
  
  I am also part of a TeamCode group that is working on a project called RefCode 2.0.  It is a project where all the apprentice( beginner) developers were introduced to a Ajile team deveolping group where developers or advsors would creat sprints, backlogs, tickets and issues to creat a beautiful website. Meanwhile, there were also, standup meetings and other task assignments. One of the advisors had suggested that the team code use the generic code ```<div> ```instead of ```<figure>```.  His suggestion was that it is easier for other coders to make changes. But the 10 best practices in html advices the other way around. 
 
 **It is confusing**
 
 Well, coding can get Really confusing; who said it was easy right? because every person thinks and applies his/her thoughts differently. 
 
 At the end of the day, the **clean code** helps other people to understand, to easly read it and to continue maintain it. _Clean Code, Clean Job!_
 
 
 
 [8. Use meaningful tags](https://blog.tbhcreative.com/2015/08/10-best-practices-in-html.html)
 
```
Each section of your web page should be built using the most appropriate 

HTML5 tag for the content. 
 
It's best to avoid excessive use of generic tags, such as <div>, 
 
when there could be a more descriptive tag for the job such as <section>, <article>, and so on.

**BEM** stands for **Block Element Modifier**. The engineer explaned very beautifuly.  When I saw the stick-man,  it reminded me of [GOT YOUR BACK MEME](https://imgflip.com/i/1dee61)
Eventhough different people would have different approaches in regards to styling, the **BEM** seems easy to understand. Also, it definily differed from the type of class names I have been using.

**DESIGN AND LAYOUT** 
I am stating the following to easly remember of the term **White Space** and **ISN"T** mean to be offensive, but humouros. My entire life, I have head of a *Black day, Black Friday, Black Sheep, Black hole, and etc*  However, the Web Dev has a *White Space* that is useless and ugly :)

Design and Layout isn't for everyone.  Some people are creative some not, some people are gifted some are not. But, to do a great User friendly Interface, if the web developer follows very few important rules, the outcome could be attractive.

Some of the rules are:
* Think like a designer
* Proximity : Using visual space: group related items
* avoid White space:  It means negative spaces: unwanted spaced between texts or images
* Alignment : Aligning texts uniformly: be consistent with the composition : and follow the Hierarchy 
* Contrast Color: size or contrasting text
* Repetition:The same style, the same colors, will help the viewer to relax
